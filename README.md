## Overview

This project is a responsive portfolio website themed around **Darth Maul** from *Star Wars*.  
The purpose of the site is to demonstrate core front-end development skills, with emphasis on **semantic HTML**, **responsive design**, **CSS/Bootstrap usage**, and **version control with GitHub**.

The content theme is secondary; the primary focus is on **technical implementation and code quality**.

- Custom theme styling

This demonstrates effective version control practices.

---

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements include:
- Additional portfolio items
- JavaScript-driven interactivity
